"""Restore assertions: what a dump has to prove before anyone would trust it.

The rehearsal these encode was run by hand on 2026-08-31 against the first backup taken from
the post-upgrade schema. The point of writing it down is that a drill nobody repeats is a drill
that stops being true, which is the same failure the backup cron itself had.
